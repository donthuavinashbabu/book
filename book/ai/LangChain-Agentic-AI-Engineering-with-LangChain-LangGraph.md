# Udemy - LangChain- Agentic AI Engineering with LangChain & LangGraph

# What is LangChain?
* Open source framework that simplifies the process of building LLM powered applications. Like  to Spring in Java
* Provides tools and abstraction that make it easier to create complex LLM powered applications
* Widely adopted. Specially by developers who can build LLM applications without understanding how machine leaning works, how to train models. But use models as black box
* Gives library to connect with LLM and switch between LLMs with simple configuration without changing business logic

## LangChain Prompts
* Help prompts management, optimization, serialization
* Create prompt template. Inject values to prompt at run time. Like `String.format`

## Document loaders
* Helps us to load different data sources like Notion, pdf files, notepads, email etc

# What is an agent?
* Software system that use LLM as reasing engint to decide what actions to take and execute those actions
* In chain - sequence of steps are hard coded. In agents - Dynamically determine which tools or steps need to be taken to solve specific task. LLM in agent decides what to do next
